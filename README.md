# Ethical-vs-Deceptive-Visualizations

Using the 2019 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) Scores, 2 visualizations were created. One ethical and unambiguous and one deceptive and misleading.

### Note on the CPI data
The higher a country’s CPI score, a result of high scores from many factors like country risk, competitiveness, freedom, justice, etc., the less corruption that is present in that nation. Therefore, the higher a country is ranked in CPI score, the more desirable a place to live and the happier the citizens are.

### Differentiating Ethical and Deceptive Visualizations
On the ethical side, the interactive visualization was clear and appropriate to demonstrate that higher CPI scores corresponded with better higher ranking. However on the deceptive side, ambiguous and misleading axis and graph titles made it seem like the higher a country scores on CPI – with country risk and competitiveness as factors – the more corruption that is present in that country.
